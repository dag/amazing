= Todo

* Maybe auto-include scripts from ~/.amazing/something
* Improve output format of --list-widgets
* Some widgets need to support multiple data sources
* Some way to do alerts, e.g. "blinking"
* Make widget configuration screen specific
* Support widgets with multiple bars and graphs (maybe wait for 2.3)
* Install script, Ra{nt,ke}file, {test-,r}spec, rubygems...?
* More widgets, duh
