= Todo

* Maybe auto-include scripts from ~/.amazing/something
* Self-documenting widgets (list fields and options) (done in widgets)
* Some widgets need to support multiple data sources
* Some way to do alerts, e.g. "blinking"
* Make widget configuration screen specific
* Support widgets with multiple bars and graphs (maybe wait for 2.3)
* Maybe keep custom widget options at same level as other options
* More widgets, duh
